Case Study 1 – Attrition Analysis (KNN &amp; Naive Bayes Models)
**Course:** MSDS 6306 – Doing Data Science  
**Student:** Nicholas Vandra  
**Date:** October 26, 2025

## Overview
This case study analyzes employee attrition using classification models (KNN and Naïve Bayes) to identify key drivers of turnover and build predictive models that meet minimum performance thresholds (60% sensitivity and specificity).

---

## Key Findings
- Employees with lower satisfaction, higher overtime, and longer commute distances are more likely to leave.  
- The **top 3 attrition factors**:  
  1. Work-life balance  
  2. Monthly income  
  3. Overtime frequency

## Model Results
| Model | Accuracy | Sensitivity | Specificity | ROC AUC |
|--------|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| KNN | 0.81 | 0.65 | 0.74 | 0.79 |
| Naïve Bayes | 0.77 | 0.61 | 0.72 | 0.76 |
